# AI-Projekt

This is a project where I am going to create a program using only AI. All of the prompts and answers will be in the prompt.txt file

To use this application you need the following requirements: 
    1. Python installed
    2. Promptkit installed. 

    1. Installing Python
        To install python simply visit their website and install python, don't forget to check the box which adds python to the path.

    2. Getting promptkit
        Simply type the command "pip install prompt_toolkit" in the terminal of the project.

To use the application run the command: python setup_dev_machine_windows.py
After running this command the app application should start, to navigate, enter the number of the program you want to install.
When you have selected a program use the press enter and the program should start installing. 
If you wish to exit the application instead select 6 and press enter or press ctrl + c if needed.


NOTES: 
I have to say that it was fun using AI to create a project, however I feel like AI kind of just does not do what you want sometimes without telling you, making it really hard to debug, since you don't know whats missing in the first place. It was however fun, to debug quite a bit since I haven't done that in a while. The program worked fine on my computer and I hope it does on your too. The reason I wanted to do this specific application is because I am getting a new pc soon so I thought it would be a good idea for an AI project.
